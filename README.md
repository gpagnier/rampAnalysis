# rampAnalysis
This script essentially takes in a csv with data, organizes, categorizes it, and produces 4 graphs 
per condition (a condition would be high odds for instance). These are all across-subj. analyses. 
1) Propensity to gamble histogram, 2) RT for all of that condition, Propensity to gamble as a function
of when gamble was introcued (important graph), and reaction time on gambles that were accepted.

Also does additional descriptive stuff etc and grouped across all participants. 

August 2018: adding logistic regression stuff.
